# BrightLife
Application designed for complete control of visual media. Adds user defined specification for volume and distinctness in LEDs.
Idk, if you can think of a better way to word it Josh you should.
Using Android Studio

# Getting project from Git
Under VCS tab at the top of your studio
  -> Checkout from Version Control
    -> Git: URL = https://github.com/jakeRoemer/BrightLife.git
            Parent Directory is the directory you want your project in. Probably under AndroidStudioProjects
IMPORTANT: Always Pull before Commiting or Pushing. Reduces chance of conflicts. If a conflict arises we should contact each other during the start to reduce heartache.
